# Smart-Farm-Using-Automation_3725

Smart Farming Automation technique provides a perfect ideal development, In this project we are doing smart farming using automation with an Arduino Uno which will automatically irrigate the plant, Ground moisture sensors which sense the soil, Motor, Battery and Relay module .
Our project (future vision), I have decided two phases of the project.

* 1st ~ First Phase: In this project we will use smart irrigation system and it will automatically create watering schedule and operation time to meet specific landscape requirements. These controllers significantly improve outdoor water use efficiency.

* 2nd ~ Second Phase: NPK sensor which will help in preventing excessive use of fertilizer and do proper soil analysis.

* 3rd ~ Third Phase : I will take advantage of the service of crop harvesting as well as integrating AI and ML (with the use of a robotic arm).

I've Collect the Best Data Related to Agriculture Products to Train the Machine and Transform that's using ML or AI through to Grow the Farming. This can be implemented in our farms and can help the farmers in producing higher yield with his minimum efforts.
